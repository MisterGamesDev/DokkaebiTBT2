## Game Over UI Prefab Setup

To properly set up the GameOverUI, create this hierarchy in Unity:

1. Create a Canvas (UI > Canvas)
   - Set Canvas to Screen Space - Overlay
   - Scale Mode: Scale With Screen Size
   - Reference Resolution: 1920x1080
   - Set Sort Order to a high value (e.g., 100) to ensure it displays on top

2. Under Canvas, create a Panel called "GameOverPanel"
   - Anchor: Stretch all sides (full screen)
   - Add Image component with a semi-transparent black color (RGBA: 0,0,0,0.8)
   - Set this as the `gameOverPanel` reference in the GameOverUI script

3. Under GameOverPanel, create a Text (TMP) object called "MessageText"
   - Anchor: Center
   - Font Size: 72
   - Font Style: Bold
   - Color: White or Gold
   - Alignment: Center
   - Text: "VICTORY!"
   - Set this as the `messageText` reference in the GameOverUI script

4. Under GameOverPanel, create a Button called "RestartButton"
   - Anchor: Center
   - Position: 0, -150, 0 (below the message)
   - Size: 300x80
   - Button text: "RESTART"
   - Set this as the `restartButton` reference in the GameOverUI script

5. Add the GameOverUI script to the Canvas

6. Initially, set the GameOverPanel to inactive in the Inspector

This setup creates a full-screen overlay with a message and restart button that appears when the game ends.
